      <Docs.Text>
        Color is modeled based on why something should be a certain color,
        defined with semantic names that allow them to adjust based on context.
        This makes it trivial to re-use components in different environments
        without having to manually adjust foreground colors.
      </Docs.Text>
      <Docs.Text>
        For example, let&apos;s assume we have the following piece of text:
      </Docs.Text>
      <Docs.CodePreview
        Example={() =>
          source(
            <Text color="label" size="17pt" weight="bold">
              Lorem ipsum
            </Text>
          )
        }
        disableActions
        showCode
      />
      <Docs.Text>
        By default, this text will either be dark or light based on whether the
        app is in light mode or dark mode.
      </Docs.Text>
      <Docs.Text>
        Now, imagine that this text was nested inside of a dark container across
        both light and dark modes:
      </Docs.Text>
      <Docs.CodePreview
        Example={() =>
          source(
            <>
              <Box background="blue" padding="20px">
                <Text color="label" size="17pt">
                  Lorem ipsum
                </Text>
              </Box>
              <Box background="purple" padding="20px">
                <Text color="label" size="17pt">
                  Lorem ipsum
                </Text>
              </Box>
            </>
          )
        }
        disableActions
        showCode
      />
      <Docs.Text>
        Typically in this scenario we&apos;d need to alter the text color so
        that it has sufficient contrast against the background. However, when
        setting a background with <Docs.Code>Box</Docs.Code>, the color mode is
        automatically configured for nested elements based on whether the
        background is dark or light, meaning that foreground colors usually
        won&apos;t need to be changed.
      </Docs.Text>
    </>
