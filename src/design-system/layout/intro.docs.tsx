        In a component system, the role of layout components is to apply space
        within containers and between sibling elements. For this model to work,
        individual components should <Docs.Strong>not</Docs.Strong> have any
        surrounding space. If components have margins built into them, it
        becomes difficult to compose them into a layout because space will be
        unbalanced by default.
      </Docs.Text>
      <Docs.Text>
        To better understand layout, let&apos;s step through the available
        layout components and show how they can be composed together.
      </Docs.Text>
      <Docs.Blockquote>
        <Docs.Text>
          Note that all layout components accept spacing values from our
          standard space scale (e.g.{' '}
          <Docs.Code>space=&quot;20px&quot;</Docs.Code>) which helps reduce the
          amount of variation in our layouts. These are modeled as strings to
          make autocompletion easier and to allow for other naming conventions
          in the future. If you need to use a value that doesn&apos;t exist in
          the scale, it can be provided in the following format:{' '}
          <Docs.Code>
            space={'{{'} custom: 17 {'}}'}
          </Docs.Code>
          .
        </Docs.Text>
      </Docs.Blockquote>
    </>
  ),
};

export default docs;
