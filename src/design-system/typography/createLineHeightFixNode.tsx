// On Android, space between lines of multiline text seems to be irregular
// when using certain fonts.
// The workaround posted on GitHub adds 1 to the line height correction node but
// this adds a noticeable amount of space below the baseline. The workaround still
// seems to work as long as the line height differs from the parent node.
// To remove this additional space we've dropped the line height offset to an
// arbitrarily small number that's close to zero.

    <NativeText style={{ lineHeight: lineHeight - 0.001 }} />
