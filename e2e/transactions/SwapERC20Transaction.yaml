# CHECKLIST:
# [x] RNBW-4855 - ERC20 > ETH
#     - Blockers:
#       - Quotes aren't generating for ETH output swaps
#       - Need to figure out where in the flow it's getting stuck
# [x] RNBW-4857 - Swaps entry from Discover page
# [x] RNBW-4856 - Approvals ??? Since were swapping an ERC20 ?
# [ ] RNBW-4861 - Check the viability of Swaps Warnings on Anvil / CI.

# So the flow should look like:
# 1. Maybe look into account impersonation
# 2. Start with DAI on an account were impersonating
# 3. Select DAI as input token VIA Discover page
# 4. Select ETH as output token
# 6. Check the viability of Swaps Warnings on Anvil / CI.
# 7. Execute Approval + Swap
# 8. Update balance check
